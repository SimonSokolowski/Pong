Welcome to my game.

This game was built in visual studio. To play, download the file and open visual studio. Run the game in release mode.

The controls for single-player are:

- Press "1" at the beginning of the game for single-player.
- Up/Down arrow keys for movement.
- "R" to initiate random color change.

If you would like to try two-player mode instead, the controls will also be:

- Press "2" at the beginning of the game for multiplayer.
- "W" to move up.
- "S" to move down.

Enjoy!
